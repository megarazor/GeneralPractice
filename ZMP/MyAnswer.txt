1. Write a function to find the angle between the minute and hour hand in an analog clock. (Python and C++)
	
	Please have a look at "clock_angle.py" and "clock_angle.cpp"

2. What is a virtual function in C++ and how does the compiler handle them?
	
	In C++, a virtual function is a base class's member function, overridden by a derived class.

	The compiler handles virtual functions with runtime binding via VPTR and VTABLE. When a virtual function is declared in the base class and is overridden in a derived class, if at runtime that function is called by a pointer of the base class, the overridden version of it will be called. This is a way to achieve polymorphism. (demonstrated in source code "virtual_function.cpp")

	How the compiler performs that is that each time an object of a class with a virtual function is generated, a virtual pointer VPTR is added to it as a member, pointing to the VTABLE of that class. Every time the virtual function is called, C++ must go to that VTABLE to determine the correct mapping to call the right function. All of that means two additional costs to use virtual functions: extra memory and extra performance steps.

3. Write a command-line program to evaluate a set of equations. (must be C++) (Python and bash are optional plus)
    Like:
    a=b+4
    b=c+d
    d=4
    c=3+2
	
	Please have a look at "equation_set.cpp" and "equation_set.py"

1. Suffix With Unit
	
	Please have a look at "suffix_with_unit.py"

2. JSON Manipulation and Bash Scripting
2a. JSON Manipulation
	
	Please have a look at "json_manipulate.py"
	
2b. Bash Scripting

	Please have a look at json_manipulate.sh
	This also requires file "json_manipulate_files.py" and 2 folders "json_data" and "json_data_converted"

3. Ground plane detection

	Please have a look at "ground_plane_detection.html" or "ground_plane_detection.ipynb"
